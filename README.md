# Catch the Fish #
A simple Whack-a-mole type game made with Javascript.

Instead of moles, I decided to use a fish image. So, the game is now Catch the Fish. 

# Rules of the Game #
The timer will start. 
Click on as many fish as possible to earn points.
After 60 seconds, your score will appear.

# This app uses #
- document.querySelector
- textContent
- forEach
- addEventListener
- setInterval
- classList.add

This project was made following a youtube video made by Ania Kubow. Thank you Ania for your well explained tutorials and videos.
